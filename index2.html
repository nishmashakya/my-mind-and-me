				<h2>Therapy</h2>
				<p>
					The most popular type of therapy utilized by people with mental health conditions is psychotherapy. This is also known as "talk therapy" where you talk with a therapist or counselor, who can deal with thoughts, behaviors, symptoms, stresses, goals, past experiences and other areas that can promote your recovery. It can  offer an emotional release and a sense of being heard, understood and supported!
